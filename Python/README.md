# Microsoft.Recognizers.Text for Python

## Getting Started

Recognizer's are organized into groups and designed to be used in C#, Node.js, Python and Java to help you build great applications! To use the samples clone our GitHub repository using Git.

## Cloning and building the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text.git
    cd Recognizers-Text

### Manual Build

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

    cd python/libraries/resource-generator
    pip install -r .\requirements.txt
    python index.py ..\recognizers-number\resource-definitions.json
    python index.py ..\recognizers-number-with-unit\resource-definitions.json
    python index.py ..\recognizers-date-time\resource-definitions.json

You can then install each of the local packages:

    pip install -e .\libraries\recognizers-text\
    pip install -e .\libraries\recognizers-number\
    pip install -e .\libraries\recognizers-number-with-unit\
    pip install -e .\libraries\recognizers-date-time\

To run tests:

    pytest --tb=line

### Automatized Build

Launch `Build.cmd` file to install requirements, generate resources, install local packages and run all tests.

## Installation from PyPI

Install Recognizer's by launching the following commands:

* Get the numbers Recognizer's features:
`pip install recognizers-text-number`

* Get the number with unit Recognizer's features:
`pip install recognizers-text-number-with-unit`

* Get the date time Recognizer's features:
`pip install recognizers-text-date-time`

Or install Recognizer's suite with the following command:

`pip install recognizers-text-suite`

## API Documentation

Once the proper package is installed, you'll need to reference the package:

````Python
from ms_recognizers_text import Culture, ModelResult
from ms_recognizers_number import NumberRecognizer
from ms_recognizers_number_with_unit import NumberWithUnitRecognizer 
from ms_recognizers_date_time import DateTimeRecognizer 
from ms_recognizers_sequence import SequenceRecognizer 
````

Or, using the suite package:

````Python
import recognizers_suite
````


### Recognizer's Models

This is the preferred way if you need to parse multiple inputs based on the same context (e.g.: language and options):

```Pyton
recognizer = NumberRecognizer(Culture.English)
model = recognizer.get_number_model()
result = model.parse('Twelve')
```

Or, for less verbosity, you use the helper methods:

```Python
from ms_recognizers_number import recognize_number, Culture

result = recognize_number("Twelve", Culture.English)
```

Internally, both methods will cache the instance models to avoid extra costs.

### Microsoft.Recognizers.Text.Number
* **Numbers**

    This recognizer will find any number from the input. E.g. _"I have two apples"_ will return _"2"_.

    `recognize_number('I have two apples', Culture.English)`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `NumberRecognizer(Culture.English).get_number_model()`

* **Ordinal Numbers**

    This recognizer will find any ordinal number. E.g. _"eleventh"_ will return _"11"_.

    `recognize_ordinal('eleventh', Culture.English)`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `NumberRecognizer(Culture.English).get_ordinal_model()`

* **Percentages**

    This recognizer will find any number presented as percentage. E.g. _"one hundred percents"_ will return _"100%"_.

    `recognize_percentage('one hundred percents', Culture.English))`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `NumberRecognizer(Culture.English).get_percentage_model()`

### Microsoft.Recognizers.Text.NumberWithUnit
* **Ages**

    This recognizer will find any age number presented. E.g. _"After ninety five years of age, perspectives change"_ will return _"95 Year"_.

    `recognize_age('After ninety five years of age, perspectives change', Culture.English)`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `NumberWithUnitRecognizer(Culture.English).get_age_model()`

* **Currencies**

    This recognizer will find any currency presented. E.g. _"Interest expense in the 1988 third quarter was $ 75.3 million"_ will return _"75300000 Dollar"_.

    `recognize_currency('Interest expense in the 1988 third quarter was $ 75.3 million', Culture.English)`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `NumberWithUnitRecognizer(Culture.English).get_currency_model()`

* **Dimensions**

    This recognizer will find any dimension presented. E.g. _"The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours."_ will return _"6 Mile"_.

    `recognize_dimension('The six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours.', Culture.English)`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `NumberWithUnitRecognizer(Culture.English).get_dimension_model()`

* **Temperatures**

    This recognizer will find any temperature presented. E.g. _"Set the temperature to 30 degrees celsius"_ will return _"30 C"_.

    `recognize_temperature('Set the temperature to 30 degrees celsius', Culture.English)`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `NumberWithUnitRecognizer(Culture.English).get_temperature_model()`

### Microsoft.Recognizers.Text.DateTime
* **DateTime**

    This recognizer will find any date, time, duration and date/time ranges, even if its write in colloquial language. E.g. _"I'll go back 8pm today"_ will return _"2017-10-04 20:00:00"_.

    `recognize_datetime("I'll go back 8pm today", Recognizers.Culture.English)`

    Or you can obtain a model instance using:

    `DateTimeRecognizer(Recognizers.Culture.English).get_datetime_model()`

## Integration tips

The Recognizers aim to bridge people's spoken language and machine's programming languages.
As such, Recognizers were designed to facilitate growing the number of supported _cultures_ (i.e. spoken languages) and _platforms_ (i.e. programming languages.)
 
With this goal in mind, they are designed to disjoint the specific culture's logic from the recognizer's core implementation. A shared set of tools are available at the heart of a *cross-culture & cross-platform* approach that will help with extending the number and range of the recognizers.


To achieve this, the recognizers contains the following folders:

* [Specs](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/tree/master/Specs) - Contains all the necessary tests that should be run on any improvements to the recognizers. It's divided by recognizer and supported language.
* [Patterns](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text/tree/master/Patterns)  - Contains all the regular expressions that fulfill the recognizers logic. It's divided by supported language.
